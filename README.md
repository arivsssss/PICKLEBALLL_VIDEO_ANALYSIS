# 🏓 Pickleball Video Analysis 🎥  

## 📌 Introduction  

Welcome to **Pickleball Video Analysis**, an advanced tool for tracking **player movement, ball shot speed, and in-game statistics** using cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning techniques. This project analyzes **pickleball matches** to provide **actionable insights** into player performance, speed, and court positioning.

## ✨ Features  

👉 **Player & Ball Detection** 🎯  
- Uses **YOLO v8** for highly accurate player detection.  
- Fine-tuned **YOLOv5** for precise pickleball tracking.  

👉 **Court Mapping & Visualization** 🎾🏙️  
- Generates a **"mini court"** visualization showing player & ball positions in real-time.  

👉 **Comprehensive Speed Analysis** ⚡📊  
- **Ball Shot Speed:** Measured in **km/h** for each shot.  
- **Player Movement Speed:** Tracks movement both **while receiving shots** and **throughout the match**.  
- **Total Distance Covered:** Calculates how far each player moves during the game.  

👉 **Advanced Match Statistics** 📊📈  
- **Shot Count:** Number of shots played by each player.  
- **Receiving Positions:** Tracks where players receive the ball.  
- **Court Positioning Data:** Helps analyze gameplay patterns.

## 🔬 Methodology  

### 🏃️ **Speed Calculation Approach**  
1️⃣ **Shot Detection**  
   - Identifies frames where the ball is hit.  
   - Determines **which player hit the ball** based on proximity.  

2️⃣ **Distance Calculation**  
   - Converts **pixel distances** to **real-world meters** using court dimensions.  
   - Uses standard pickleball court width: **6.10 meters (20 feet)**.  

3️⃣ **Speed Calculation Formula**  
   - **Ball Speed:**  
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance in meters}}{\text{Time in seconds}} \times 3.6
     \]  
     *(Converts m/s to km/h)*  
   - **Player Speed:**  
     - Tracks movement **between shots** & **frame-by-frame** to determine total distance traveled.
